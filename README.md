## Overview 
This project uses recursive logic to find possible solutions to a crossword puzzle similar to WordHunt, a game available 
on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/word-hunt/id1357352041">App Store</a> for Apple & Mac devices. The app is deployed and hosted through Streamlit, a service that enables developers to create Single Page Applications using only Python.

### Flow
A user is prompted to specify the dimensions of an N x N grid (ie 3 rows, 3 columns, etc.)

The user is then offered the choice to either populate the letters in the grid, or use the `randomize` feature to have letters generated for them.

The app turns the grid into a series of traversable nodes and references a standard english dictionary for which letter combinations make up valid english words.

The list is returned to the user along with the longest word, which the grid highlights.

A reset button allows the user to start over.

### Remarks: Streamlit 
Streamlit is a reactive framework, similar to `react.js`, and uses a session state to manage variables. Any time the user interacts with the application, the main script re-executes. To this end, the app logic is configured in chunks inside of a single `main` function that terminate by providing a null return statement in order to lock the user into a single portion of the app flow.
